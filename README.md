# Codices-fx

Desktop version of **Codices** application, developed in JavaFX.

**Codices** was a pet project used to test programming languages, libraries, frameworks, etc., and often
in various courses I've taught. It was never a usable product and the project repository was full of 
temporary code.

**Codices-fx** is a Desktop based application, being developed in JavaFX, using SQLite databse for storage, 
and will contain all the features that were intended for the original **Codices** project.

The desktop version is one of 3 that will be developmed (the other two are WEB based using PHP and Yii2/3, 
and using Scala and the Play framework).

> The ```main``` branch will be the stable branch after the first release, until a version 1.0 is released, 
> the branch is considered unstable and will often break (code may not compile).

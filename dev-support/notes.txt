Moving from Yii2 to JavaFX; Keep:
- Current main fields, 1-to-1 publisher, 1-to-1 series, ISBN, many-to-many authors, many-to-many genre; not sure about tags;
- Consider adding price per book and per collection
- Would custom fields be useful? Maybe version 2.
- For ebooks and audiobooks, link(?) to files (may need a user directory, somewhere in user's home?)
- Allow for back cover also? may for 1.5 or 2.0
